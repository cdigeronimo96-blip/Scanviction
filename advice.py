"""MarketSignalPro — recommendation label + plain-English insight generators (pure).

Extracted from app.py. Pure of app/session state: maps a score + factor breakdown
(and optional fundamentals / OHLCV) to a human recommendation label, a set of
plain-English insight badges, and a risk color. No Streamlit; colors come from theme.
Used by BOTH the warm worker (get_recommendation) and the detail UI (get_insights).
